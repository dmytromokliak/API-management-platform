API Platform embraces open web standards and the
[Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) movement. Your API will automatically expose structured data.
It means that your API Platform application is usable **out of the box** with technologies of
the semantic web.

It also means that **your SEO will be improved** because **[Google leverages these formats](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data)**.

Last but not least, the server component of API Platform is built on top of the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) framework,
while client components leverage [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) flavors are also available).
It means that you can:

* Use **thousands of Symfony bundles and React components** with API Platform.
* Integrate API Platform in **any existing Symfony, React, or Vue application**.
* Reuse **all your Symfony and JavaScript skills**, and benefit from the incredible amount of documentation available.
* Enjoy the popular [Doctrine ORM](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html) (used by default, but fully optional:
  you can use the data provider you want, including but not limited to MongoDB and Elasticsearch)
